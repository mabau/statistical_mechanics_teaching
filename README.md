## Overview

With this Python package you can create and visualize molecular dynamics simulations with the LAMMPS framework (http://lammps.sandia.gov/). 
It provides setups that illustrate basic concepts of statistical mechanics. 

## Installation

This package depends on lammps which is a C++ framework with a Python interface. The lammps package is only available
on conda. So this package should be installed with conda as well (http://conda.pydata.org/docs/). It is currently
only available for 64bit Linux.

```
conda install --channel=lssfau statistical_mechanics_teaching
